        Hello, and welcome to the first page of Week 1 in Front-End Development. 
    I will be typing useless information in here until I fill a few spaces. This is the first webpage I am building in the Promideo Front End Developer class. It is built using just HTML. 
    There is no CSS or JavaScript at this time.  So enjoy the plain boring site until i can add some more details to somethign else.
